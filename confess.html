    <h3>Hi, I guess you're wondering by now how you got here.</h3>
    <p id="msg">I’ll get straight to the point—I’ve had a crush on you for a long time, ever since senior high school. Your presence always caught my attention, and I was surprised to see you here at CHMSU. Before, I used to walk by like it was nothing, but lately, I can't even walk normally when you’re around. You might not notice it, but I forget how to walk when you’re near! So, I took a chance and added you on social media. When you accepted my friend request, I was so excited that I literally threw my phone!
    <br>
    <br>
    I spent several days thinking about what to message you. I was so shy that I even asked my little sibling to send the message for me. And when you replied, I couldn’t believe it! My whole college experience changed—I suddenly felt more motivated to go to school because of you. I know I seem shy and just walk by like nothing, but after we pass each other, your name stays on my mouth for hours. I keep telling my friends about you, and I even replay that moment for a long time—it always makes my day.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you ever read this, please smile the next time we pass each other—it means the world to me. <3
